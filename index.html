	at impulse.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 45614.6.
			We have been contacted by an
			androgynous race called the J'naii
			to investigate the disappearance
			of a shuttlecraft.

2    INT. BRIDGE

	PICARD, RIKER, WORF, DATA, SUPERNUMERARIES, and several
	J'naii, including SOREN and KRITE. The J'naii are a
	genderless species; Soren and Krite, like the others,
	possess no demonstrable sexual characteristics. All
	the J'naii look remarkably alike: strikingly
	attractive, with lithe, slim bodies and chiseled,
	delicate features. Soren is near Riker; Krite at an
	aft station.

					DATA
			We are approaching the designated
			coordinates, Captain.

					PICARD
			On screen.

2A   ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	It shows the starfield -- no sign of a shuttlecraft.

					PICARD
			Long-range scan, Mister Data.

	Data enters commands.

					DATA
			Sensors find no evidence of the
			shuttle anywhere within the star
			system.

         STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - TEASER         2.

2A   CONTINUED:

					SOREN
			It couldn't have travelled outside
			the system.

					RIKER
			Mister Data, reconfigure for a
			high-resolution sweep with a
			radius of one million kilometers.
			Look for possible debris.

	Data works controls once more.

					DATA
			Scan shows no debris within
			that radius.

					KRITE
			I don't understand it. A
			shuttle doesn't simply vanish.

	Soren turns to Riker, frustrated.

					SOREN
			There has to be an explanation...

	But before Riker can answer--

         STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - TEASER         3.

2A   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA
			Captain, I am detecting an unusual
			reading... It appears to be a
			neutrino emission with no visible
			source.

					PICARD
			Explanation?

					DATA
			I have none. I recommend we
			launch a probe.

					PICARD
			Make it so.

	Soren peers intently at the viewscreen.

					WORF
			The probe is launched.

	A probe shoots off from the Enterprise and is clearly
	visible on the viewscreen.

       STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - TEASER       4.

2A   CONTINUED: (3)

					DATA
			The probe is transmitting
			information within normal
			parameters. Sensors do not show
			evidence of any unusual phenomenon
			--

	Suddenly the probe vanishes from the screen, and from
	Data's instruments.

					DATA
			The probe is no longer
			transmitting.

					SOREN
			What happened? Where did it go?

	And on the various reactions around the bridge --

3    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit around a blue-green planet.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, supplemental. The
			sudden disappearance of our probe
			suggests that we may have found
			the first instance of what is
			called null space -- an anomaly
			which until now had been only
			theoretical. Commander Riker has
			been working around the clock with
			a team of J'naii specialists to
			formalize this hypothesis.

4    INT. J'NAII CIVIC CHAMBER - DAY (OPTICAL)

	Riker, Soren, Krite, NOOR (head of government), and
	other J'naii leaders are gathered to discuss the
	situation. The room is not huge -- just larger than
	the observation lounge.

	Soren and Riker are standing near a monitor in the
	wall, upon which an Okudagram illustrates the gases
	and vapors that swirl into the formation of a star.

					SOREN
			During the creation of a star
			system, when clouds of
			interstellar dust and gas
			coalesce... turbulent regions of
			magnetic and gravitational fields
			may develop.

	The monitor reflects this, showing dense fields of
	disturbance.

					SOREN
			If certain conditions occur,
			these fields can condense into
			abnormal pockets of space.

	Soren turns and glances at Riker. He and Soren have
	been working together on this project, and there's
	already an easy familiarity between them.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      6.

4    CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			We think your system contains one
			of these null pockets.

	Riker pushes controls and the monitor shows a star
	system in which one section, or "pocket" is
	significantly different from the space surrounding it.
	Riker points to it.

					RIKER
			If we're right, this pocket would
			absorb electromagnetic energy from
			anything that entered it...

					SOREN
			Like a shuttlecraft.

					RIKER
			Or a probe. Making them
			powerless.

					SOREN
			But outside the pocket, all energy
			is bent around it -- making it
			naturally cloaked. That's why
			we can't see it, and sensors don't
			read it.

					NOOR
			Is the shuttle still there?

					RIKER
			We think so. The ship probably
			couldn't sustain its power...
			but other than that it wouldn't
			be damaged.

					SOREN
			Since our shuttles carry
			plestorene-based backup systems,
			we think life support would
			sustain for as long as ten days.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      7.

4    CONTINUED: (2)

					NOOR
			Then perhaps our crew has
			survived...

					RIKER
			We can send one of our shuttles
			into the null space -- but its
			energy output would be absorbed
			as well. Our chief engineer is
			working on a way to maintain the
			power reserves long enough to
			rescue your crew.

					NOOR
			Commander... we're grateful for
			your help.
				(rising)
			Whatever resources we can provide
			are yours.

	Noor heads for the door, followed by the others.
	Riker turns to Soren.

					SOREN
			I've been thinking... when the
			time comes, I'd like to pilot the
			shuttle.

	Riker is a little surprised at this.

					RIKER
			It's a Starfleet craft...

					SOREN
			I can't ask you to put yourself
			in danger to rescue our crew.

					RIKER
			You can't pilot a shuttle you're
			not familiar with.

	Soren hesitates, realizing the truth of what he's
	saying... but not wanting to give up.

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        7A.

4    CONTINUED: (3)

					SOREN
			I happen to be a good pilot...

	A beat.

					RIKER
			I happen to be a good pilot, too.
			I also know my way around
			Starfleet shuttles. So... what
			if we team up?

	Soren considers, looks at him, smiles.

					SOREN
			When can we go over your shuttle
			flight operations?

					RIKER
			Right now.

	And he gestures Soren out of the room.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      8.

5    INT. SHUTTLE BAY

	Riker and Soren walk around the shuttlecraft.

					RIKER
			It's a short-range craft... with
			two twelve-hundred fifty
			millicochrane warp engines...

					SOREN
			Looks like microfusion
			thrusters...

					RIKER
			Right.

					SOREN
			Armament?

					RIKER
			Usually none. But it's been
			fitted with two type-four phaser
			emitters... we'll use them to
			chart the null space.

					SOREN
				(puzzled)
			Chart it?

					RIKER
			Commander La Forge wants to get
			an idea of how big this pocket
			is. He thinks the rate of energy
			absorption will be linked to its
			size.

					SOREN
			I'm not sure how we go about
			mapping something we can't see...

					RIKER
			That's where the emitters come
			in. We'll shoot a series of
			photon pulses into the pocket and
			chart the points where they
			disappear. We should be able to
			plot a fairly complete outline
			that way.

	Soren gives him a look and smiles, nodding. She turns
	to ENTER the shuttle.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      9.

5    CONTINUED:

					SOREN
			Let's take a look at the controls.

	Soren enters the shuttlecraft, followed by Riker.

5A   INT. SHUTTLE

	They sit at the controls.

					RIKER
			Maybe later we can try a flight
			simulation, but first let's do
			a systems review.
				(taps controls)
			I'll walk you through it...

	Soren gives him a quick look, puts hands on the
	controls.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      10.

5B   CLOSE ON MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	The monitor on the panel jumps to life, scrolling
	through a systems review.

5C   BACK TO SCENE

					SOREN
			Propulsion system... transfer
			conduits... where's the schematic
			of the reactor assembly? Oh,
			there it is... engine nacelles...

	She looks over at Riker, who is watching her go through
	the review at top speed.

					SOREN
			There's nothing here that's
			unfamiliar.

	She continues manipulating the console like a pro.

					SOREN
			Navigational deflector...
			redundant graviton polarity source
			generators...

	Riker is watching in admiration.

					RIKER
			You're handling those controls
			like you grew up in a shuttle...

					SOREN
			I did. My parents were pilots.
			I started flying with them before
			I could walk. And as soon as I
			was old enough, I entered flight
			school. Krite was my instructor.

					RIKER
			He had a good student.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      11.

5C   CONTINUED:

	Soren looks at him, coolly amused.

					SOREN
			"He?" Commander, there are no
			"he's" or "she's" in a species
			without gender.

	Riker grins, throws up his hands.

					RIKER
			Okay. For two days I've been
			trying to construct sentences
			without personal pronouns. I give
			up... what should I say? "It?"
			To us, that's almost rude.

					SOREN
			We use a pronoun which is neutral.
			But it doesn't really have a
			translation.

					RIKER
				(good-naturedly)
			Then I'll just have to muddle
			through... so be tolerant if a
			stray "he" or "she" slips by,
			okay?

	Soren smiles at him and they work for a beat more.

					SOREN
			Well, if that's the systems
			review, I don't see any problems
			here. What's next?

	Riker smiles in admiration for this quick study.

					RIKER
			Lunch.

	Soren looks at him. Smiles.

8    INT. TEN FORWARD

	Riker at a table with Soren. In the background, beyond
	them, is a couple in intimate conversation, heads
	close. We will see them later. A waiter has just set
	bowls of soup on Riker's table.

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        12.

8    CONTINUED:

	Soren peers down at it, puzzled.

					SOREN
			What is it?

					RIKER
			Split pea soup. My father's
			recipe. I had it programmed into
			the replicators.

	Soren takes a spoonful, touches her tongue to it.
	(NOTE: From this point on, for the sake of
	convenience, feminine pronouns will be used in
	reference to Soren.) She tastes it, is not displeased,
	takes a little more.

					RIKER
			Well?

					SOREN
			Unusual... but I think I like
			it...

					RIKER
			It's very healthy. Helps keep
			you warm on a cold Alaskan night.

					SOREN
			We prefer to stay warm by sleeping
			with a friend.

	The statement is startling in its casualness. Riker
	looks at her, taken aback.

					RIKER
			I see...

					SOREN
				(explaining)
			Not to mate... just to sleep
			together. For warmth.

					RIKER
			Sounds better than pea soup.

	Soren gives him a direct, penetrating look.

					SOREN
			We are puzzling to you, aren't
			we?

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        13.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			A little. It's hard to grasp the
			idea of having no gender...

					SOREN
			It's just as hard for us to
			understand the strange division
			you have in your species... males
			and females.

	Riker can't help but smile. Soren's gaze drifts to
	the couple in the corner, who are being openly
	affectionate with each other.

					SOREN
			You... are male.

	Riker nods, not certain where this is leading.

					SOREN
			Tell me... about males. What is
			it that makes you different from
			females?

	A tall order. Riker considers.

					RIKER
			Snips and snails and puppy dog's
			tails...

	She stares at him, dumbfounded.

					SOREN
			You have a dog's tail?

					RIKER
				(laughing)
			That's an old nursery rhyme.
			Girls are made of sugar and spice.
			Boys are made of snips and
			snails...

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE      14.

8    CONTINUED: (3)

					SOREN
			That makes it sound better to be
			female.

					RIKER
			It's an old fashioned way of
			looking at the sexes. Not to say
			that there aren't real
			differences. Physically, men tend
			to be bigger... stronger in the
			upper body. We have different
			sexual organs. Men don't bear
			young...

					SOREN
			What about... feelings? Emotional
			attitudes? Are they different?

					RIKER
			Well... most people think so.
			But that's the kind of question
			that might take an hour or two
			to answer.

	She smiles and glances again at the affectionate
	couple.

					RIKER
			Let me ask you...
				(struggling a bit)
			What's it like... on a planet where
			the people have no gender?

	She gives him a curious look.

					SOREN
			I'm afraid I don't understand.

					RIKER
			Well... who leads when you dance?
			If you dance...

					SOREN
			We do... and... whoever's taller
			leads.

	She gives him a direct look, and he can't tell whether
	she's kidding or not. He keeps it in a playful mode.

					RIKER
			Without the "battle of the
			sexes"... you probably don't
			have as many arguments...

     STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT ONE     14A.

8    CONTINUED: (4)

	She regards him with amusement.

					SOREN
			Just because we don't have gender
			doesn't mean we don't have
			conflict. We're very strong-
			minded... we love a good fight.

	He eyes her, taken by her wit and her forthrightness.

					RIKER
			Sounds like there aren't that
			many differences between your
			species and mine...

	She smiles, looking directly at him.

					SOREN
			Maybe not.

	Soren hesitates only briefly before the next question,
	which she asks casually.

					SOREN
			What kind of woman do you find
			attractive?

	Riker gives her a slight look, wondering where this
	questioning is coming from.

					RIKER
			I like a woman who's intelligent
			and sure of herself... somebody
			I can talk to and get something
			back.
				(beat)
			But the most important thing of
			all -- she has to laugh at my
			jokes.

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        15.

8    CONTINUED: (5)

	Soren does.

					SOREN
			And is that the kind of woman all
			human males prefer?

					RIKER
			Not at all. Some men like quiet,
			demure women... others prefer a
			lot of energy... some respond only
			to physical attractiveness...
			others couldn't care less. There
			aren't any rules.

	She smiles at him. Her eyes flicker over to the
	couple, who exchange a brief kiss.

					SOREN
			You make it sound very complex.

					RIKER
			Believe me -- it is.

	Soren looks into his eyes. A subtle but unmistakable
	change comes over her... the look is seductive. Her
	voice takes on a sensuous tone.

					SOREN
			Perhaps it is that complexity...
			which makes differences in the
			sexes... so interesting.

	She smiles at him, leaning forward slightly, waiting
	for a response. Riker is taken aback. He stares at
	her, not sure how to respond. He is rescued from the
	dilemma by the arrival of Krite, who approaches the
	table from behind Soren.

					KRITE
			Good evening, Commander.

					RIKER
			Good evening.

					SOREN
				(rising)
			Please take my place, Krite. I
			have to be going.

	Riker looks up at her; she has undergone another
	transformation. Gone is the seductiveness, the
	alluring voice, the pliant body language. She is erect
	and formal -- a typical J'naii.

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT ONE        15A.

8    CONTINUED: (6)

					SOREN
			Thank you for going over the
			flight protocols, Commander. It's
			been very helpful.

	And she walks away, Riker looking after her, puzzled.

					SOREN
			Commander... tell me about your
			sexual organs.

	Riker gives her a startled look.

					RIKER
			Ahhh...

					SOREN
			Is that an uncomfortable subject
			for Humans?

					RIKER
			No... but it doesn't tend to be
			a topic of casual
			conversation...

					SOREN
			I'm interested in your mating
			practices... what is involved
			when there are two sexes.

	Riker takes refuge in a moment of distraction from
	their mapping project.

	The graph is gradually taking fuller shape, delineating
	the outline of the null pocket. Soren looks at him...
	he looks over at her, sees her watching, waiting for
	his response.

					SOREN
			Mating.

					RIKER
			Right. Well, it's pretty simple.
			The men inseminate the women and
			the women carry the babies.

	Soren absorbs this.

					SOREN
			Our fetuses are incubated in
			fibrous husks which both parents
			inseminate. From what we know
			of other species, our method is
			less risky and less painful.

					RIKER
				(to himself)
			And less enjoyable...

					SOREN
				(hearing him)
			Less enjoyable?

					RIKER
				(trying to explain)
			For Humans... the sexual act
			brings a closeness... an
			intimacy... it's a very
			pleasurable experience...
				(beat: on the other
				 hand)
			Inseminating a husk...

	Soren laughs at this.

					SOREN
			That's just the last step. Mating
			is a long ritual for us... full
			of variety and invention... I
			assure you -- it's extremely
			pleasurable.

	They work for a moment in silence, then --

					SOREN
			I wonder...

	A beat.

					RIKER
			What... ?

					SOREN
			If a Human and a J'naii would be
			sexually compatible...

	A provocative question. Riker doesn't know where it's
	coming from.

					RIKER
			I don't know...

					SOREN
			Of course, it would never be
			permitted.

					RIKER
			Why not?

					SOREN
			The idea of gender... it's
			offensive to my people. You see,
			long ago we had two sexes, as
			you do. But we evolved... into
			a higher form.
				(beat)
			I don't mean to sound insulting...
			but on my planet we've been taught
			that gender is...
				(struggling for the
				 least offensive word)
			...primitive.

					RIKER
				(good naturedly)
			Primitive.

					SOREN
			Less evolved...

					RIKER
			Maybe so. But sometimes there's

					BEVERLY
			It's just a mild concussion...
			You're going to be fine.
				(using tricorder)
			This will reduce the inflammation.

	She works for a beat, then --

					SOREN
			Doctor... you are female.

	Beverly looks at her curiously.

					BEVERLY
			Yes...

					SOREN
			Forgive me... I don't mean to be
			rude... but I'm curious. What
			is it like?

	A question Beverly's rarely had to consider.

     STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO     20A.

16   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Well... it's... just the way I
			am. I've never thought about what
			it's like.

					SOREN
			What is it that makes you female?

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO      21.

16   CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			Very specific biological factors.
			Females carry two X chromosomes,
			males carry an X and a Y. Hormone
			levels are distinctly different;
			males produce primarily
			testosterone, while women produce
			estrogen. Our sexual organs are
			very different -- females' are
			geared to bearing and nursing the
			young.

	Soren takes this in for a moment.

					SOREN
			I've noticed... that you tend to
			have longer hair... you arrange
			it more elaborately... and you
			apply color to your bodies.

	Beverly is bemused by this objective assessment.

					BEVERLY
			Color... ?

					SOREN
			You put color on your mouths...
			your eyes... your cheeks... even
			your fingernails. The men don't.

					BEVERLY
			That's true...

					SOREN
			Why do you decorate yourselves
			like that?

					BEVERLY
			It's a long-time custom... we're
			used to it...
				(beat -- with a smile)
			... but I think the real reason
			-- is to attract men.

					SOREN
			Really?

					BEVERLY
			Mmmm-hmmmm...

	Soren ponders this a moment.

     STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/3/92 - ACT TWO     21A.

16   CONTINUED: (2)

					SOREN
			Then... it's up to women to
			attract the men?

					BEVERLY
			Oh, believe me, men want to be
			attractive, too -- but they go
			about it differently.

					SOREN
			No color...

					BEVERLY
			No color. They'd rather
			pretend they're not doing
			anything to attract a woman...
			even when it's the most important
			thing on their minds.

					SOREN
			It's very confusing.
				(beat)
			Are women considered superior?
			Or are men?

					BEVERLY
			Neither. In the past, women were
			often considered weak and
			inferior. But that hasn't been
			true for a long time.

					SOREN
			Do you... enjoy being a woman?

	Beverly thinks, decides, smiles.

					BEVERLY
			Yes. As a matter of fact, I enjoy
			it a lot.

	Soren smiles at her, and at this point Riker ENTERS.

					BEVERLY
			Will... your co-pilot is fine.
			The injury was minor.

	Riker's smile toward Soren is relieved.

      STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT TWO      22.

16   CONTINUED: (4)

					RIKER
			I'm glad to hear it.

	Riker approaches her, and during the next, Beverly
	picks up on the attitude... subtle but unmistakeable...
	that Soren is very attracted to Riker.

					SOREN
				(lightly)
			I'm afraid you're not rid of me
			yet, Commander. I'll be able to
			complete the mission.

					RIKER
			Then you should hear my new
			regulation: no more gymnastics
			in the shuttlecraft.

	She smiles. He looks at her, a more serious tone
	in his voice.

					RIKER
			I'm glad you're all right...

	She hears the concern in his voice, flushes slightly,
	looks down. She seems unaccountably nervous, and
	Beverly takes note.

					SOREN
			What happened... why did the
			shuttle go into a spin?

					RIKER
			Apparently, the port engine nacelle
			nicked one of the protrusions from
			the null pocket, and shut down.

					SOREN
			Are we still on schedule for the
			rescue attempt?

					RIKER
			That depends on how you're doing.

	She slips off the bed.

16   CONTINUED: (4)

					SOREN
			I'm fine. We should check out
			the port engine --

	Riker puts his hands on her shoulders to restrain her.
	She stops instantly, as though the touch has
	electrified her.

					RIKER
			Whoa... let's get the doctor's
			opinion first...

	He takes his hands off her shoulders and she takes
	a breath, turns to Beverly.

					SOREN
			Doctor... ?

					BEVERLY
			I don't see a problem. But if
			you have any symptoms... headache,
			dizziness -- come back.

					SOREN
			You have my word.

	They EXIT, and Beverly looks after them, wondering if
	she saw something -- something personal -- happening
	between them.

17   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS

	A poker game in session -- Data, Worf, Troi, Beverly.
	Troi is shuffling.

17   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			All right... this round, the game
			is -- Federation Day.

	Worf reacts with distaste.

					WORF
			What is that?

					TROI
			The Federation was founded in
			Twenty-one-sixty-one. So twos,
			sixes, and aces are wild.

	Worf looks almost queasy.

					WORF
			That is a woman's game.

					TROI
				(unbothered)
			Oh? Why is that?

	She proceeds to deal.

					WORF
			All those wild cards... they
			support a weak hand. A man's game
			has no wild cards.

					BEVERLY
			Let me get this straight. Are
			you saying it's a woman's game
			because -- because women are weak
			and need more help?

					WORF
				(why else?)
			Yes.

					BEVERLY
				(with a sigh)
			And just this afternoon I was
			insisting to one of the J'naii
			that those attitudes were nothing
			but a distant memory.

	He arranges his cards.

					WORF

					TROI
			Why, Worf?

					WORF
			They just do.

	She gives him a penetrating look.

					WORF
			They are all alike. No males.
			No females.

					TROI
			I'm sure we're just as strange
			to them.

	Worf gives her an incredulous look.

					BEVERLY
			Well, one of them seems to be
			overcoming the differences... at
			least with regard to one of us...

	They stare at her, uncomprehending.

					WORF
			What are you saying, Doctor?

					BEVERLY
			I could be wrong... but I get the
			definite impression that Soren...
			is attracted to Commander Riker.

	They all take this in. Worf is certain in his
	pronouncement.

					WORF
			A human and a J'naii?
			Impossible.

			Good question. Worf?

	Worf grunts and buries his nose in his cards.

					WORF
			With all the wild cards, it is
			difficult to know exactly what

	Smiling, he pushes chips into the middle. The others

					RIKER
			Not yet. Geordi figures it'll

	She squeezes her self next to Riker, sitting on the

	close. She now accesses the thrust manifold.

					SOREN
			There...

					RIKER
			Okay, calibrate it to arc at

					RIKER
				(still involved in work)
			What's that?

					SOREN
			I... find you attractive.

	Riker stops his work, turns to look at her.

					SOREN
			I'm taking a terrible risk,
			telling you that. It means...
			revealing something to you...
			Something that, if it were known
			on my planet, would be very
			dangerous for me.

	He stares at her, not knowing what she means.

        STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT TWO        27.

18A  CONTINUED: (3)

	As Soren reveals her story, she is at first halting,
	uncertain, and timorous.

					SOREN
			Occasionally, among my people,
			a few are born who are --
			different. Who are throwbacks
			to the era when we all had gender.
			Some are born with strong
			inclinations toward maleness...
			and some have urges to be female.
				(beat)
			I am one of the latter.

					RIKER
			I have to admit... I got the
			feeling you were different.

					SOREN
			I was hoping you would. But in
			front of Krite and the others,
			I must be careful not to reveal
			myself.

					RIKER
			Why?

					SOREN
			On our world these feelings are
			forbidden. Those who are
			discovered are shamed and
			ridiculed. Only by undergoing
			psychotectic therapy and having
			all elements of gender eliminated
			can they become accepted into
			society again.

	Riker is dismayed by her story.

					SOREN
			Those of us who have these
			urges... live secret, guarded

	Riker is a bit overwhelmed by all this. His mind
	struggles to accommodate the bizarre story she is
	telling.

					RIKER
			How long have you known you were
			like this?

					SOREN
			I've known I was different all
			my life. But I didn't understand
			how or why until I was older.

					RIKER
			And when you realized... what
			then?

	Soren pauses a moment, searching to provide a context
	for the answer.

					SOREN
			I remember when I was very
			young... before I understood what
			I was... there was a rumor in
			my school that one of the students
			preferred a gender... in that
			case, male. The children started
			making fun of him... every day,
			they got more cruel... They could
			tell he was afraid... and that
			seemed to encourage them.
				(beat)
			He appeared in class one morning,
			bleeding... his clothes ripped.
			He said he'd fallen down.

	She takes a breath, trying to regain composure in the
	face of this ugly memory.

					SOREN
			Of course the school authorities
			heard about it... They took him

			When he came back... he stood in

			us how happy he was now that he
			had been cured.

	There is a long silence.

					SOREN
			After that... I knew how dangerous
			it was to be different. And as
			I got older, and realized what
			I was, I was terrified.
				(a breath)
			I've lived with that fear ever

					RIKER
			Do you have... relationships...

					SOREN
			Yes -- with those who have
			discovered they are male.

	Riker stares at her, mind reeling. She lifts a hand
	and touches his face, gently.

					SOREN
			I've had to live a life of

			I can be honest.

	He starts to speak, but she covers his lips with her

					SOREN
			Don't say anything. Just... think

					GEORDI
			Okay, Commander, everything checks

	Geordi looks from Riker to Soren.

					GEORDI
				(to Soren)
			You'll have to give him continuous

			I can't even predict if the drain

	transporter is giving its all. But finally, the group
	MATERIALIZES onto the rear deck of the shuttle, intact
	-- and still inside null space.

	Riker and Soren look at each other. It didn't work.

	Riker thinks for a moment, mind racing to figure a way
	out of this predicament. Soren is using a tricorder,
	inspecting the unconscious shuttle crew.

					RIKER
			If we just sit here, we'll lose
			all our systems within an hour
			-- including life support.

	Riker turns to the controls, begins tapping
	instructions.

					RIKER
			I'm rerouting the propulsion
			system to the transporter...
				(to Soren)
			Rechannel the navigation
			systems...

	Soren obeys, working quickly.

					RIKER
			Let's transfer every microjoule
			of energy we've got... sensors...
			life support... this might give
			us one last shot.

					SOREN
			An energy shift of that size...
			it'll overload the phase
			compensators... the shuttle --

					RIKER
			Will explode. But if we stay here
			we're dead, anyway.

	He works his controls once more.

	He watches the console, monitoring the energy surge. A
	HUM is swelling in intensity. Their eyes meet... a
	charged look...

					RIKER
			See you in a minute.

	He pushes controls and the shimmering EFFECT takes them
	over, pulses slightly... the HUMMING sound gets
	louder... they vanish... and the shuttle EXPLODES from
	the force of the energy surge.

					PICARD
			We'd be happy to.

	Krite moves toward Soren.

			Noor will be eager to get a

			return to the surface.

	Soren nods and turns toward Riker; their eyes meet.

					SOREN
				(formally)
			I will see you tonight then,

	Riker inclines his head, just as formally, but still
	holding her look. Krite notices the look, and then

	on a bench, listening to the SOUND of festivities
	within. Presently, Soren appears.

			There you are, Commander. I

					RIKER
			Just getting some fresh air.
				(beat)
			I can take so much of these social
			functions... then I need to
			breathe a little.

	She sits on the bench -- at a distance. She is erect
	and proper.

					SOREN
			I would think you had attended
			so many affairs like this it would
			be second nature to you.

					RIKER
			I was raised in the outdoors.
			I'm never that comfortable in
			crowded rooms...

	There is a silence. The tension between them is
	palpable. Several of the J'naii from inside stroll
	by. As though fearing exposure, Soren and Riker fall
	into a polite formality.

					SOREN
			What do you think of our planet?
			Isn't it beautiful?

					RIKER
			Yes. Quite beautiful.

					SOREN
			We have many varieties of plant
			life...
				(gesturing into the
				 woods)
			Perhaps you would like to inspect
			some of them.

					RIKER
			Yes, I would. I've always been
			interested in exobotany.

	She rises, maintaining the formal posture.

					SOREN
			Please. Let me take you on a

			Thank you. It's very kind of you.

	They move off toward the woods. Camera pans back
	toward the civic chamber. Standing in the darkness,
	watching them, is Krite.

30   EXT. PLANET - INTO THE WOODS

	Riker and Soren walk along a path. She points out
	various trees and shrubs.

					SOREN
			One of my favorites is this
			menellen tree. The leaves first
			turn pure white, and then blue
			when the weather gets cold...

	They move on, deeper into the woods.

					SOREN
			This is called a falla bush...
			it produces a fragrant flower on
			only one day of the year...

	She moves on... but Riker reaches out and takes her
	arm, turns her back to him. They stand like that for
	an instant, staring at each other, shrouded in the
	cover of the woods, moonlight catching and reflecting
	in Soren's eyes. She parts her lips... moves toward
	him without even realizing she's doing it... and then
	they are locked in one another's arms, kissing deeply,
	as though it were the most natural thing in the world.

32   INT. TROI'S QUARTERS

	Troi sits on her couch, inspecting the contents of a
	box which rests on the floor. There are several
	artifacts spread out on a coffee table -- small
	figures, a doll, pictures, little books, etc. Troi
	holds a larger book on her lap and is leafing through
	the pages. The door CHIMES.

					TROI
			Come in.

	The door opens and Riker ENTERS. She looks up, smiles
	at him.

					TROI
			Hello, Will.

	He comes to her, sits nearby, where he can see what
	she's looking at.

					RIKER
			What's all this?

					TROI
			Wonderful things... my mother sent
			me a box that belonged to one of
			my father's ancestors. It had
			been stored on Earth years ago
			and just recently turned up.

	Riker picks up one of the pictures.

					RIKER
			Do you know who these people are?

			No. A few of the pictures are
			marked with names... but most of
			them aren't. I look at all these

	Riker picks up a small, worn, stuffed animal and turns
	it in his hands.

					RIKER
				(playful)
			This one looks like you...

	She smiles at him... there's a long beat between them.
	Then--

			Deanna... I've got something on my

			Has something happened?

	He looks up at her, nods.

					RIKER
			I've met someone... someone who's
			becoming important to me...

					TROI
			Soren...

					RIKER
			Yes.

	There is a moment as the two friends gaze at each
	other, the look speaking of trust and affection that
	is deep-seated.

					RIKER
			You're my friend... so it seemed
			like...
				(beat)
			I'm not sure. It just seemed
			right to tell you.

					TROI
			I'm glad you did.

					RIKER
			Nothing will change between us,
			will it?

	She smiles.

					TROI
			Of course it will. All
			relationships are constantly
			changing.

	She reaches out and touches his cheek.

					TROI
			But we will always be friends.
			Maybe even better friends.
			You're part of my life, and I'm
			part of yours. That much will
			always be true.

	He leans forward and they kiss, sweetly and tenderly.

33   INT. ENGINEERING

	Riker and Soren work with Geordi; Krite and another
	J'naii are in the background, monitoring a console.
	Riker and Soren are in their formal mode.

					GEORDI
			Turns out the null pocket is even
			more irregular than we expected,
			Commander.

					RIKER
			Maybe its configuration is
			shifting.

					GEORDI
			I don't think so... the
			measurements you took are holding.
			It just has more projections than
			we thought. It's going to take
			longer than we planned to get it
			mapped.

	No response from Riker or Soren, with whom the delay is
	just fine.

					GEORDI
			I'm headed for the shuttle bay.
			We're fitting another shuttle to
			help in the survey.

	Geordi turns and EXITS. Riker and Soren do not look
	at each other.

					RIKER
				(casually)
			Have you made plans for dinner
			this evening?

					SOREN
			I have some paperwork to do...
			I thought I'd start on it...

					RIKER
			I'd like to discuss some of our
			suggestions for regulating travel
			around the null space. Maybe we
			could have an early dinner... so
			you could still get your work done
			afterwards.

	An innocuous enough exchange... they keep on working.

					RIKER
			Hello. I'm here to see Soren...

					KRITE
			I know.

					RIKER

			Where's Soren?

			And we're going to make sure it

					RIKER
			Answer me -- where is Soren?

	A little smile from Krite.

					KRITE
			Gone. In custody. And there's
			nothing you can do about it.

	Riker stares at him, mind racing, trying to figure what
	to do. He makes a decision.

					RIKER
			The hell there isn't.

	And he turns and strides down the corridor.

36   INT. PLANET CIVIC CHAMBER

	Soren sits before a panel of "judges," including Noor.
	A gallery of citizens fills the room.

					NOOR
			You are aware of the charges
			against you?

					SOREN
			Yes.

					NOOR
			Do you intend to dispute them?

	Soren does not answer.

					NOOR
			Well? What is your response?

	Suddenly the doors to the chamber slam open and Riker
	ENTERS, striding toward the judges' table amid the
	hubbub of the startled onlookers. He marches right
	toward Noor. Soren stares at him, astonished.

					RIKER
			Are you in charge here?

            STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT FOUR            45.

36   CONTINUED:

					NOOR
			Commander Riker -- these
			proceedings are closed to anyone
			but --

					RIKER
			I think I just opened them.

					NOOR
			Sir, this is a private matter.
			We are grateful for your recent
			help, but that gives you no right
			to interfere with our personal
			concerns --

					RIKER
			I want you to know what really
			happened. It's all my fault.
			I was attracted to Soren. I
			pursued... I insisted. I didn't
			understand your ways until Soren
			told me. And rejected me.
			Nothing happened between us.

	He pauses, looking from one to the other for an
	indication of their response.

					RIKER
			I ask your forgiveness. I
			behaved... inappropriately.

	Noor takes this in. Ponders it. Turns to Soren.

					NOOR
			Is this true?

	Soren hesitates... looks at Riker. Then she rises,
	moves toward Noor.

					SOREN
			No.

					RIKER
			Soren --

				(to Riker)
			I am tired of lies.

	She turns to Noor, head held high.

			I am female. I was born that way.
			I have had those feelings...
			those longings... all my life.

	She takes a breath, desperately hoping to communicate
	to her countrymen.

					SOREN
			It is not unnatural. I am not
			sick because I feel this way.
			I do not need to be helped, and
			I do not need to be cured. What
			I do need -- what all of those
			like me need -- is your
			understanding and your compassion.

	She walks along the line of her accusers.

					SOREN
			We do not injure you in any way.
			And yet we are scorned, and
			attacked. And all because we are
			different.

	A hush has fallen over the room as everyone listens
	to her impassioned speech.

					SOREN
			What we do is no different from
			what you do. We talk and laugh...
			we complain about work and we
			wonder about growing old... we
			talk about our families, and we
			worry about the future...
				(beat)
			We cry with each other when things
			seem hopeless.

			All the loving things that you

			What right do you have to punish

	She looks straight at Noor, passion and conviction

	Continuous action. Soren has just make her

					NOOR
			I congratulate you, Soren. Your

	He lifts his hand to gesture toward guards.

					RIKER
			No, wait... you don't have to do

	Noor turns to him, mildly irritated.

					NOOR
			Commander?

					RIKER
			Let me take her away. She can
			come with me, we'll give her
			asylum on the Enterprise. You'll
			never have to see her again.

	Noor hesitates, as though considering the suggestion.

					RIKER
			That would solve the problem,
			wouldn't it? You'd be rid of

	Noor smiles gently at Riker, as though at a small child

			Commander, after Soren's diatribe,

					RIKER
			I'm just trying to find a solution

					NOOR
			In fact, we are a remarkably free
			and open society. Our people have

			them a great deal of
			self-determination. We are, by
			all measurements, an enlightened
			race.

					RIKER
			Then how is it... that Soren has
			no choice about her sexual
			orientation?

					NOOR
			We are concerned about our
			citizens. We take our obligations

			sick... and sick people need to
			get well.

					RIKER
			Did it ever occur to you she
			might prefer to stay the way she
			is?

					NOOR
			You don't understand. We have

			without exception -- they have
			become happier people after their
			treatment. And grateful... that

					NOOR
			Take her to quarters. Treatment

					RIKER
			Don't do this --

	Riker moves toward her, but several of the J'naii step
	between him and Soren, and a crowd envelops her,
	whirling her away from him. The last he sees of her
	is her head, twisting back to look for him, her eyes

			Soren --

	Riker starts to plow through the group around him, but

			Sir, their minds are set. They

			If you violate it, you may be

			Commander, I have the plan for

	The courtyard/garden. Riker, now dressed in N.D. dark
	clothing, is positioned in the woods, watching toward
	the civic center. The building is lit, and there is
	activity inside. Worf, also in dark clothing, comes up
	to him through the trees.

41   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			The meeting is ending. I
			think they will bring her out of
			the building soon.

					RIKER
			Okay. They'll probably come
			down that path... we can take
			cover there --
				(gesturing)
			-- behind those rocks.

					WORF
			Yes, Commander.

					RIKER
			She'll be under guard... no
			telling how many...

					WORF
			I will handle the guards. You
			take her to cover.

	Riker notices something in the building.

			Something's happening...

	He lifts the binoculars, peers through them.

41AC	CIVIC CENTER - HIS POV (OPTICAL)

	Through a futuristic grid, an opening to the civic
	chamber shows the J'naii moving about in the room.

					RIKER
			They're leaving.

41A  ANGLE - ON WORF AND RIKER

	as they emerge from the shadow of the trees. They
	creep across the courtyard, moving from shadow to
	shadow, toward the civic chamber. Several J'naii
	EXIT into the courtyard. Riker and Worf take cover.

41B  ON THE J'NAII

	Two J'naii walk by their position... neither one is
	Soren.

41C  RIKER AND WORF

	glance at each other. Riker points toward the doors
	-- opening once more.

41D  THREE J'NAII

	EXIT and walk off in another direction.

41E  RIKER AND WORF

	exchange another frustrated glance. Then Worf nods
	toward the doors, seeing another group.

42   ANGLE - HALLWAY LEADING TO CIVIC CHAMBER

	as Soren and two guards EXIT the structure, heading
	down the path toward the courtyard.

42A  ANGLE - RIKER AND WORF

	exchange a look and crouch down. As the trio
	approaches, Riker and Worf step out in front of them.
	The guards react, surprised. Riker smiles at them,
	ingenuously.

					RIKER
			Could you excuse us? I have to
			talk to her...

	But the guards go into attack mode, throwing punches
	toward Riker. He blocks the blows and then Worf steps
	in and engages the two of them. Riker takes Soren's
	arm and pulls her toward the woods.

43   ON RIKER AND SOREN

	hurrying into the woods.

					SOREN
			Wait...

					RIKER
			Don't worry... we'll be out of
			here in a minute...

43   CONTINUED:

	He is intent on getting to their prearranged meeting
	place. They are pushing through bushes, shrubs, etc.

					SOREN
			Will, please...

					RIKER
			We're almost there...

	Finally they move into a clearing, where they are
	sheltered by trees and bushes, but moonlight
	illuminates the clearing. Riker stops, turns to her.

					SOREN
			You can't do this...

					RIKER
			I won't let them hurt you. You'll
			be safe on the Enterprise.

	She turns away from him, silent. Puzzled, he takes
	a step toward her.

					RIKER
			Soren...

	She turns back, looking at him with curious detachment.

					SOREN
			I'm so sorry... it's my fault you
			got involved in all this...

					RIKER
			It's going to be all right...
			everything's going to be fine...

					SOREN
			No, it's not.

	He stares at her, not comprehending her strange
	attitude.

					RIKER
			What are you talking about?

					SOREN
			It was all a mistake. I should
			have realized it from the
			beginning...

					RIKER
			What... ?

43   CONTINUED: (2)

					SOREN
			That I was sick. I had these
			terrible urges... that's why I
			reached out to you... but it was
			wrong. I see that now.

	And now he understands. She's already been treated.
	He is too late.

					SOREN
				(a little shake of her
				 head)
			I don't understand how I could
			have done... what I did.

	He grasps for anything...

          STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - REV. 1/6/92 - ACT FIVE         55.

43   CONTINUED: (3)

					RIKER
			Maybe... maybe Doctor Crusher
			could treat you... bring you
			back... to the way you were
			before.

	She smiles sadly at him, truly sorry for his pain, but
	disconnected from it.

					SOREN
			Why would I want that?

					RIKER
			Soren... I love you.

	She looks at him, not even vague regret in her eyes...
	as though looking at someone she knows she once loved,
	but can't remember why.

					SOREN
			I'm sorry.

	And she turns and melts into the darkness. Riker
	stares after her.

45   INT. BRIDGE

	Picard, Data, and N.D. personnel. Picard is forward,
	talking to Data and the Conn Officer.

					PICARD
			How long to the Phelan system?

					DATA
			At warp six, fifty-three hours,
			sir.

            STAR TREK: "The Outcast" - 1/2/92 - ACT FIVE            56.

45   CONTINUED:

	The turbolift doors open and close, pulling Picard's
	look. Riker EXITS the turbolift and starts down the
	ramp.

					PICARD
			Commander... ?

	Riker is impassive, his face revealing nothing, but
	his voice is tight.

					RIKER
			Captain.

	They hold a look for a moment. Riker sits.

					PICARD
			Starfleet has just sent a message
			asking us to proceed to the Phelan
			system to negotiate a trade
			agreement.

					RIKER
			Yes, sir.

					PICARD
			I wasn't sure when to tell them
			we'd be underway.
				(beat)
			Is our business with the J'naii
			finished?

					RIKER
			Finished, sir.

	There is another beat, and then Picard turns to the
	Conn Officer.

					PICARD
			Very well. Ensign, take us out

			Phelan system. Warp six.
				(beat)
			Engage.

	OFF Riker's reaction...

Captain's log, stardate 45614.6. We have been contacted by an
androgynous race called the J'naii to investigate the mysterious
disappearance of one of their shuttlecraft.
</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Bridge]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(the J'naii are wearing loose-fitting one-piece
suits and all have short hair) <br>
DATA: Captain, we are approaching the designated coordinates. <br>
PICARD: On screen. Long range scan, Mister Data. <br>
DATA: Sensors find no evidence of the shuttle anywhere within the star
system. <br>
SOREN: It couldn't have travelled outside the system. <br>
RIKER: Mister Data, reconfigure high resolution sweep, radius one
million kilometres. Check for any debris. <br>
DATA: Scan shows no debris within that radius. <br>
KRITE: I don't understand it. A shuttle doesn't simply vanish. <br>
SOREN: There has to be an explanation. <br>
DATA: Captain, I am detecting an unusual reading. It appears to be a
neutrino emission with no visible source. <br>
PICARD: Explanation? <br>
DATA: I have none, sir. I recommend we launch a probe. <br>
PICARD: Make it so. <br>
WORF: Probe is launched. <br>
DATA: Sensors show no evidence of any unusual phenomenon. <br>
(then the probe vanishes) <br>
DATA: The probe is no longer transmitting. <br>
SOREN: What happened? Where did it go?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. The sudden
disappearance of our probe suggests that we may have found the first
instance of what is called null space, an anomaly which until now had
been only theoretical. Commander Riker has been working around the
clock with a team of J'naii specialists to formalise this hypothesis.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Civic chamber]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOREN: During the creation of a star system, when
clouds of interstellar dust and gas coalesce, turbulent regions of
magnetic and gravitational fields may develop. If certain conditions
occur, these fields can condense into abnormal pockets of space. <br>
RIKER: We think your system contains one of these null pockets. If
we're right, the pocket would absorb electromagnetic energy from
anything that entered it. <br>
SOREN: Like a shuttlecraft. <br>
RIKER: Or a probe. Making them powerless. <br>
SOREN: But outside the pocket, all the energy is bent around it, making
it naturally cloaked. That's why we cannot see it, and our sensors
cannot read it. <br>
NOOR: Is the shuttle still there? <br>
RIKER: We think so. The shuttle probably wasn't able to sustain its
energy, but other than that it wouldn't be damaged. <br>
SOREN: Since our shuttles carry plestorene based backup systems, we
think life support would sustain for as long as ten days. <br>
NOOR: Then perhaps our crew has survived. <br>
RIKER: We can send one of our own shuttles, but its energy would also
be absorbed. Our Chief Engineer is working on a way to maintain the
power reserves long enough to rescue your crew. <br>
NOOR: Commander, we're grateful for your help. Whatever resources we
can provide are yours. <br>
(the council members leave) <br>
SOREN: I've been thinking. When the time comes, I would like to pilot
the shuttle. <br>
RIKER: It's a Starfleet craft. <br>
SOREN: I cannot ask you to put yourself in danger to rescue our crew. <br>
RIKER: You can't pilot a shuttle you're not familiar with. <br>
SOREN: I happen to be a good pilot <br>
RIKER: I happen to be a good pilot, too. And I know my way around the
Starfleet shuttle. So what if we team up? <br>
SOREN: When can we go over the shuttle flight operations? <br>
RIKER: Right now.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(shuttle 15 Magellan, with Onizuku in the
foreground) <br>
SOREN: Is this the one? <br>
RIKER: This is it. Short-range craft, two twelve hundred fifty
millicochrane warp engines. <br>
SOREN: Looks like microfusion thrusters. <br>
RIKER: Right. <br>
SOREN: Armament? <br>
RIKER: None, usually. This one's been fitted with two type-four phaser
emitters. We'll use those to chart the null space. <br>
SOREN: Chart it? <br>
RIKER: Mister La Forge wants to get an idea of the size of the pocket.
He thinks the rate of energy absorption is linked to its size. <br>
SOREN: I'm not sure how we go about mapping something we can't see. <br>
RIKER: Well, that's where the emitters come in. We shoot out a series
of photon pulses into the pocket and chart where each one disappears.
From that we should get a fairly complete outline. <br>
SOREN: Let's take a look at the controls.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Shuttlecraft]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">RIKER: Later we'll try a flight simulation. Right
now let's do a systems review. I'll talk you through it. <br>
SOREN: Let me try it. Propulsion system, transfer conduits. Where's the
schematic reactor assembly? Oh, there it is. Engine nacelles. There's
nothing here that's unfamiliar. Navigational deflector, redundant
graviton polarity source generators. <br>
RIKER: You handle these controls like you grew up in a shuttle. <br>
SOREN: I did. My parents were pilots. I was flying with them before I
could walk. And as soon as I was old enough, I entered flight school.
Krite was my instructor. <br>
RIKER: He had a good student. <br>
SOREN: He? Commander, there are no he's or she's in a species without
gender. <br>
RIKER: Okay. For two days I've been trying to construct sentences
without personal pronouns. Now I give up. What should I use? It? To us,
that's rude. <br>
SOREN: We use a pronoun which is neutral. I do not think there is
really a translation. <br>
RIKER: Then I'll just have to muddle through. So forgive me if a stray
he or she slips by, okay? <br>
SOREN: Well, if that's the systems review, I don't see any problem.
What's next? <br>
RIKER: Lunch.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>[Ten Forward]</b>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">SOREN: What is it? <br>
RIKER: Split pea soup. It's my father's recipe. I had it programmed
into the replicators. Well? <br>
SOREN: Unusual, but I think I like it. <br>
RIKER: It's very healthy. Helps to keep you warm on cold Alaskan
nights. <br>
SOREN: We prefer to stay warm by sleeping with a friend. <br>
RIKER: I see. <br>
SOREN: Not to mate. Just to sleep together for warmth. <br>
RIKER: Still sounds better than pea soup. <br>
SOREN: We are puzzling to you, aren't we? <br>
RIKER: A little. It's hard to grasp the idea of no gender. <br>
SOREN: It's just as hard for us to understand the strange division in
your species. Males and females. You are male. Tell me about males.
What is it that makes you different from females? <br>
RIKER: Snips and snails and puppy dog tails? <br>
SOREN: You have a dog's tail? <br>
RIKER: It's an old nursery rhyme. Girls are made from sugar and spice,
and boys are made from snips and snails. <br>
SOREN: That makes it sound better to be female. <br>
RIKER: It's an old-fashioned way of looking at the sexes. Not to say
that there's no real difference between them. Physically, men are
bigger, stronger in the upper body. We have different sexual organs.
Men can't bear young. <br>
SOREN: And what about feelings, or emotional attitudes? Are they
different? <br>
RIKER: Most people think so. But that's the kind of question that would
take a lifetime to answer. Let me ask you, what's it like on a planet
where the people have no gender? <br>
SOREN: I'm afraid I don't understand. <br>
RIKER: Well, who leads when you dance? If you dance. <br>
SOREN: We do, and whoever's taller leads. <br>
RIKER: Without the battle of the sexes you probably don't have as many
arguments. <br>
SOREN: Just because we don't have gender doesn't mean we don't have
conflicts. We're very strong-minded. We love a good fight. <br>
RIKER: From the sound of it there's not that much difference between
our species. <br>
SOREN: Maybe not. What kind of woman do you find attractive? <br>
RIKER: I like one who's intelligent and sure of herself, who I can talk
with and get something back. But the most important thing of all? She
has to laugh at my jokes. <br>
SOREN: (smiling) Tell me, is that the kind of woman that all human
males prefer? <br>
RIKER: Not at all. Some like quiet, demure women. Others prefer a lot
of energy. Some only respond to physical attractiveness. Others
couldn't care less. There are no rules. <br>
SOREN: You make it sound very complex. <br>
RIKER: Believe me, it is. <br>
SOREN: Well, perhaps it is that complexity which makes differences in
the sexes so interesting. <br>
KRITE: Good evening, Commander. <br>
RIKER: Good evening. <br>
SOREN: Please take my place, Krite. I have to be going. Thank you for
going over the flight protocols, Commander. It was very helpful.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Captain's log, supplemental. Commander Riker and

SOREN: Delta four point four by point five. <br>
RIKER: This is working. Initiating computer task hand-off. <br>
SOREN: Commander, tell me about your sexual organs. <br>
RIKER: Er. <br>
SOREN: Is that an uncomfortable subject for humans? <br>
RIKER: No, but it doesn't tend to be a topic of casual conversation. <br>
SOREN: I'm interested in your mating practices. What is involved with
two sexes? <br>
RIKER: Correcting course. Zero two one mark zero. <br>
SOREN: Mating? <br>
RIKER: Right. Well, it's pretty simple. Men inseminate the women. Women
carry the baby. <br>
SOREN: Our foetuses are incubated in fibrous husks, which the parents
inseminate. From what we know of other species, our method is less
risky and less painful. <br>
RIKER: And less enjoyable. <br>
SOREN: Less enjoyable? <br>
RIKER: For humans, the sexual act brings a closeness and intimacy. It
can be a very pleasurable experience. Inseminating a husk. <br>
SOREN: That's just the last step. Mating is a long ritual for us, full
of variety and invention. I assure you, it is extremely pleasurable. <br>
RIKER: I'm picking up a neutrino emission from within the null space. <br>
SOREN: That may be coming from our shuttle. I'll note these
coordinates. <br>
SOREN: I wonder. <br>
RIKER: What? <br>
SOREN: If a human and a J'naii would be sexually compatible. <br>
RIKER: I don't know. <br>
SOREN: Of course it would never be permitted. <br>
RIKER: Why not? <br>
SOREN: The idea of gender. It is offensive to my people. You see, long
ago we had two sexes, as you do. But we evolved into a higher form. I
don't mean to sound insulting, but on my planet we have been taught
that gender is primitive. <br>
RIKER: Primitive? <br>
SOREN: Less evolved. <br>
RIKER: Maybe so, but sometimes there's a lot to be said for an
experience that's primitive. <br>
SOREN: Delta five grid map is fully plotted. <br>
RIKER: Adjusting course. Zero two nine mark zero. <br>
(the shuttle's port nacelle workings are exposed) <br>
RIKER: The port engine's down. <br>
SOREN: Reducing power in the starboard nacelle. <br>
RIKER: That's not enough. I have to activate the manoeuvring thrusters.
<br>
SOREN: Thrusters aren't responding. I'll try to reroute the firing
sequence. <br>
RIKER: Inertial dampers are failing. Hang on! <br>
(Soren gets thrown across the floor) <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: Enterprise to shuttle, do you read me? <br>
RIKER: Affirmative. We've lost an engine. <br>
LAFORGE [OC]: We'll try to get a tractor beam on you. <br>

Soren directly to Sickbay. <br>

to be fine. This will reduce the inflammation. <br>

CRUSHER: Yes. <br>

it like? <br>
CRUSHER: Well, it's just the way I am. I've never really thought about
what it's like. <br>
SOREN: I've noticed you tend to have longer hair, and you arrange it
more elaborately. And you apply colour to your bodies. <br>
CRUSHER: Colour? <br>
SOREN: You put colour on your mouths, and your eyes, your cheeks, your
fingernails. The men don't. <br>
CRUSHER: That's true. <br>
SOREN: Then it is up to women to attract the men. <br>
CRUSHER: Oh, no. Men want to be attractive too, believe me. They just
go about it differently. <br>
SOREN: No colour. <br>
CRUSHER: No colour. They like to pretend they're not doing anything to
attract a woman, even when it's the most important thing on their
minds. <br>
SOREN: This is very confusing. Then, are women considered more
superior, or are men? <br>
CRUSHER: Neither. In the past, women were often considered weak and
inferior. But that hasn't been true for a long time. <br>
(Riker enters) <br>
CRUSHER: Will, your co-pilot is going to be fine. The injury was minor.
<br>
RIKER: I'm glad to hear it. <br>
SOREN: I'm afraid you're not rid of me yet, Commander. I will be able
to complete the mission. <br>
RIKER: Glad you feel better. <br>
SOREN: What happened? What made the shuttle go into a spin? <br>
RIKER: The port nacelle must have nipped one of the protrusions from
the null pocket and shut it down. <br>
SOREN: Are we still on schedule, then? <br>
RIKER: That depends on how you're doing. <br>
SOREN: I'm fine. We should go check the port engine. <br>
RIKER: Whoa. Maybe we should get the doctor's opinion first. <br>

headache, dizziness, come back. <br>

RIKER: Not yet. Geordi thinks that'll be ready by oh eight hundred
hours tomorrow. But before that, we should see if we can balance this
engine. Can you access the starboard manifold thrust? <br>
(Soren crawls under the control panel) <br>
SOREN: There. <br>
RIKER: Set the arc at six point three. I'll optimise the plasma flow. <br>
SOREN: Commander, I'd like to tell you something. Something that's not
easy to say. <br>
RIKER: What's that? <br>
SOREN: I find you attractive. I'm taking a terrible risk telling you
that. It means revealing something to you, something that, if it were
known on my planet, would be very dangerous for me. Occasionally, among
my people, there are a few who are born different, who are throwbacks
from the era when we all had gender. Some have strong inclinations to
maleness, and some have urges to be female. I am one of the latter. <br>
RIKER: I have to admit I had a feeling you were different. <br>
SOREN: I was hoping you would. But in front of Krite and the others, I
must be careful not to reveal myself. <br>
RIKER: Why? <br>
SOREN: On our world these feelings are forbidden. Those who are
discovered are shamed and ridiculed, and only by undergoing
psychotectic therapy and having all elements of gender eliminated can
they become accepted into society again. Those of us who have these
urges live secret and guarded lives. We seek each other out, always
hiding, always terrified of being discovered. <br>
RIKER: How long have you known that you were like this? <br>
SOREN: I've known I was different all my life. But I didn't understand
how or why until I was older. <br>
RIKER: And when you realised, what then? <br>
SOREN: I remember when I was very young, before I knew what I was,
there was a rumour in my school that one of the students preferred a
gender, in that case, male. The children started making fun of him, and
every day they were more cruel They could tell he was afraid and
somehow that seemed to encourage them. One morning in class, he
appeared, bleeding and in ripped clothes. He said he had fallen down.
And of course the school authorities found out and took him away, and
gave him psychotectic treatments. When he came back, he stood in front
of the whole school and told us how happy he was now that he had been
cured. After that, I realised how dangerous it was to be different. And
once I got older, and knew what I was, I was terrified. I have had to
live with that fear ever since. <br>
RIKER: Do you have relationships with others? <br>
SOREN: Yes, with those who have discovered they are male. I have had to
live a life of pretence and lies, but with you I can be honest. Please,
don't say anything. Just think about it.

RIKER: Any guess how long we'll have? <br>
LAFORGE: Lets just say you don't want to waste any time once you get in

SOREN: We're down to nine percent. We don't have enough to get back. <br>
RIKER: If we just sit here, we'll lose all of our systems within an
hour, including life support. Okay, I'm rerouting the propulsion
system to the transporter. Re-channel the navigation systems. Let's
transfer every microjoule of energy we've got. Sensors, life support.
This might give us one last shot. <br>
SOREN: But if we use an energy shift of that size, it'll overload the
phase compensators. The shuttle <br>
RIKER: Will explode. But if we stay here, we're dead anyway. Maximum

NOOR: Sir, this is a private matter. We are grateful for your recent
help, but that gives you no right to interfere with our personal
concerns. <br>
RIKER: I want you to know what really happened. It's all my fault. I
was attracted to Soren. I pursued. I insisted. I didn't understand your
ways until she explained them to me and rejected me. Nothing happened
between us. I ask your forgiveness. I behaved inappropriately. <br>
NOOR: Is this true? <br>
SOREN: No. <br>
RIKER: Soren. <br>
SOREN: I am tired of lies. I am female. I was born that way. I have had
those feelings, those longings, all of my life. It is not unnatural. I
am not sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do
not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like
me need, is your understanding and your compassion. We have not injured
you in any way. And yet, we are scorned and attacked. And all because
we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk
and laugh. We complain about work and we wonder about growing old. We
talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with
each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you
do with each other, that is what we do. And for that we are called
misfits and deviants and criminals. What right do you have to punish
us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can
dictate how people love each other? <br>
NOOR: I congratulate you, Soren. Your decision to admit your perversion
makes it much more likely that we can help you. <br>
RIKER: Wait, wait, wait. You don't have to do this. <br>

RIKER: Let me take her with me. She can go back to the Enterprise. We
would give her asylum. You would never have to see her again. That
would solve the problem, wouldn't it? You'd be rid of her. She would
never be able to influence anyone again. <br>
NOOR: Commander, after Soren's diatribe, you must think that we are a
cruel, repressive people. Nothing could be further from the truth. <br>
RIKER: I'm just trying to find a solution that would satisfy everyone. <br>
NOOR: We are concerned about our citizens. We take our obligations to
them seriously. Soren is sick, and sick people want to get well. <br>
RIKER: Did it occur to you that she might like to stay the way she is? <br>
NOOR: You don't understand. We have a very high success rate in
treating deviants like this. And without exception, they become happier
people after their treatment, and grateful that we care enough to cure
them. You see, Commander, on this world, everyone wants to be normal. <br>
